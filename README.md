DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel

This repository contains an implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) based on the original paper "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Ho et al.. 
The model is trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

ðŸ§  Overview
DDPMs are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by reversing a gradual noising process. 
This implementation follows the original architecture and training procedure closely, with some customization for experimentation.

ðŸ“¦ Features

Full training pipeline on CIFAR-10
Implementation of the forward (noising) and reverse (denoising) diffusion processes
Visualization of the generation process
Model checkpointing and sampling utilities

HOW TO RUN
You can simply run ddpm_probabilistic_model.py to train the UNet on CIFAR-10 dataset. After training, you can see the image generated by the process of DDPM.
